\section{Design}
\subsection{Type checking background}
type hierarchy, subtype checking, Dataflow analysis rules, polymorphism

\subsection{Determinism type hierarchy}
Diagram of type hierarchy and explanation
Examples of errors produced when subtyping rules are violated (here or in the section above this)?

\subsection{Additional typing rules for collection elements}
Lists, set and maps - element types have to be subtypes of collection type 
Explain iterator and extracting elements of an ordernondet collection here
Examples of valid and invalid types

\subsection{Avoid aliasing unsoundness}
Give an example of unsoundness 
Recall CLIMB-to-top rule and defaulting choice for local collections (to avoid too many warnings)
Required user annotations for collections and arrays

\subsection{Special cases of polymorphism}
Explain modifiers to Polymorphic annotations
Poly up and down for ordernondetermistic types
Poly use for avoiding polluting det/ordernondet collections
Subtype hierarchy among all variants of Poly
Possibility of type refinement?	

\subsection{Discussion on defaulting rules}
Choice of defaults on class type, constructors and method params and return types

\subsection{Additional hardcoded rules for precision}
Example: equals on HashSet
Discussion on System properties - env, line, file and path separator.

\subsection{Annotating more classes/providing more specifications}
Ease of annotating more JDk classes
User provided stub files to override existing behavior
