The state of the art is NonDex.  It is a highly effective tool.

% https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex/wiki/Supported-APIs
NonDex uses a hand-crafted list of 47 methods (25 unique method names) in
in 13 classes.
This is analogous to our annotations on the JDK\@.
\todo{Say how much code our annotations cover?}
\todo{Check whether our JDK is missing anything they support.}
%\todo{Did the NonDex authors contact the maintainers of the tools in which
%  they found nondeterminism?}
\todo{The NonDex authors didn't contact the maintainers of tools.
From the paper: "NonDex detected 57 previously unknown
flaky tests in open-source projects and three flaky tests
that have been already fixed by the open-source software
developers."}

\todo{A NonDet annotation:
  \url{http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=modes}}

\todo{All nondeterminism that NonDex found was due to 7 methods in 3 classes:
Class\#getDeclaredFields
Class\#getDeclaredMethods
Class\#getFields
DateFormatSymbols\#getZoneStrings
HashMap\#entrySet
HashMap\#keySet
HashMap\#values
}
