In https://github.com/jwaataja/randoop, checkout the "determinism" branch

For the total number of @SuppressWarnings, run this command:
grep -r --include='*.java' -n -e '"determinism"' | wc -l
Current output:
52
Divide into 24000 to determine lines of code per annotation:
461


For a classification of the most important reasons for @SuppressWarnings, run this command:

grep -r --include='*.java' -n -e '"determinism"' | sed 's/^.*\/\/ //' | sed 's/: .*//' | sed 's/:$//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r

Current output:

     10 https://github.com/t-rasmud/checker-framework/issues/96
      8 constructors guarantee all instances of this class are @Det
      5 expected nondeterminism
      5 can't specify receiver for anonymous class
      4 actual type toString returns @PolyDet
      2 iterating over @OrderNonDet collection to modify another
      2 enum classes of a @Det Class<?> are @Det, but the checker
      2 combining elements of @OrderNonDet collection for @Det result
      1 this is code randoop is run on
      1 this converts what was written to the stream to a String,
      1 https://github.com/t-rasmud/checker-framework/issues/95
      1 https://github.com/t-rasmud/checker-framework/issues/94
      1 https://github.com/t-rasmud/checker-framework/issues/89
      1 getRuntimeClass returns a @Det Class<?>, so casting one
      1 "--deterministic" option ensures this is deterministic
      1 constructors guarantee all instances of this class are @NonDet
      1 comparing hash codes is deterministic, even if the codes
      1 assert guarantees this is deterministic
