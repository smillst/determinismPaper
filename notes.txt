We are comparing other tools to the Determinism Checker.
Can we try to run those other tools on Randoop?
I think that would be a compelling way to argue that they don't scale.
Using a type-checker does require a commitment of time to do annotations,
which we should admit, of course.


All nondeterminism that NonDex found was due to 7 methods in 3 classes:
Class#getDeclaredFields
Class#getDeclaredMethods
Class#getFields
DateFormatSymbols#getZoneStrings
HashMap#entrySet
HashMap#keySet
HashMap#values
