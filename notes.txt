We are comparing other tools to the Determinism Checker.
Can we try to run those other tools on Randoop?
I think that would be a compelling way to argue that they don't scale.
Using a type-checker does require a commitment of time to do annotations,
which we should admit, of course.





We should claim thet we did an informal, paper-and-pencil proof of the core of the type system.
We did not do a machanized proof (such as in Coq, Isabelle, or K).
We did not do any proofs about the implementation.
